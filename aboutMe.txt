 My name is Joshua Milcette. I'm 18 and am about to be a freshman at URI. I started getting into CS about 2 or 3 years ago.
I've probably quit about 20 times but I kept picking it back up. I'm very excited about finding this program because it 
will definitely have a large role on my future success.
